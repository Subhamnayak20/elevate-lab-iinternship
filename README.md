This repository contains all the tasks completed during my AIML internship under Elevate Labs.
The work primarily focuses on implementing various machine learning algorithms using Python. 
Each task demonstrates practical understanding through Jupyter Notebooks with structured code, proper preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
The goal is to strengthen hands-on skills in applied machine learning using real-world or structured datasets.
